This directory contains a couple of small python scripts that
might help test your lab 1 front end.

Please report problems on Piazza.

TEST SCRIPT:

The test script runs an executable front end against a directory of ILOC
files. It prints all of the output from this set of runs to stdout.

The syntax is:

   test <executable name>  <directory of ILOC files>

So, to run lab1_ref on the test_input  blocks, you might type

   ./test ~comp412/students/lab1/lab1_ref  ~comp412/students/lab1/test_inputs

Do not try to run multiple instances of the tester from multiple shells on 
the same machine. The tester creates a directory in /tmp to hold all of the
miscellaneous files that it creates. Having multiple tester instances sharing
a single temporary directory will likely produce really bad results.

TIMING SCRIPT:

The timing script is similar to the test script, except that it always
runs the executable against the ILOC SLOCs Scalability test found in 
~comp412/students/ILOC/Scalability/SLOCs.

The syntax is:

    timer <executable name>

The timer reports its results on both standard out and to a log file named
with your login username.
